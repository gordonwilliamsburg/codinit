# Experiment Tracking

We log experiments under the following hierarchy:

- Run_ID: str, id of the run which comprises of a set of tasks.
- Git_SHA: str, the git sha corresponding to the run
- Commit_Message: str, the commit message corresponding to the git sha
  - Task_ID: int, id of a task, which corresponds to a set of generation attempts
  - Task: str, description of the task
    - Docs: list[str], documentation that has been retrieved by agent.
    - Plan: list[str], list of steps generated by agent
    - Generation_ID: int, id of the generation attempt
    - Code: str, corresponds the the code generated in the coding attempt
    - Linter_Output: List[str], corresponds to the list of errors detected by the linter
    - Metric: int, corresponds to the metric computed from the linter output, here the sum of errors
    - Error_Log: str, the error log obtained from python subprocess after executing the code
    - Timestamp: datetime, corresponds to the time of the code generation

## Metrics

## TODO

Add metric for when agent generates same errors
